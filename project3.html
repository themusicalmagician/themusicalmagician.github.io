                <p>This was my first experience with programming at this school and in general. Our first assignment of the first year was to make PONG from scratch and make it fully playable.</p>
                <p>Since I had no knowledge of programming whatsoever this brought up a lot of difficulties, but in the end I made it through and I made the game you see above here.</p>
                <p>This definetly took a while and the project had a lot of ups and downs, but because I ran into so many problems I have learned a lot from this project.</p>
